## Project Overview
The MCQuality project explores state-of-the-art tools and frameworks for user state detection using video data, with a focus on real-time emotion recognition. After systematically reviewing existing technologies, we selected a promising tool to build a prototype that demonstrates its potential in the field of UX and satisfaction for a specific use-case.

**Prototype Implementation**: Demonstration of the feasibility and potential of the selected solution.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: A functional prototype that detects user emotions from video streams in real time.
- **Distribution of Dominant Emotions**:
- **Emotions over Time**:

The code provides three Python files:
- **gui.py**:
- **EmotionDetectionGUI.py**:
- **EmotionDetectionRealTime.py**:
